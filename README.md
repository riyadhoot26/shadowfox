- Unit Conversions
  - Square Root
  - Exponentiation
  - Trigonometric Functions
  - Logarithm
  - Power
  - Factorial
  - Absolute Value
  - Natural Logarithm (ln)
  - Exponential (e^x)
- Scientific Calculations
  - Temperature (Celsius to Fahrenheit)
  - Temperature (Fahrenheit to Celsius)
  - Length (Meters to Feet)
  - Length (Feet to Meters)
  - Weight (Kilograms to Pounds)
  - Weight (Pounds to Kilograms)
  - Volume (Liters to Gallons)
  - Volume (Gallons to Liters)
  - Currency (USD to EUR)
  - Currency (EUR to USD)
- Input validation and error handling
- A simple and interactive console interface

### Console-Based Contact Management System
I created a **Console-Based Contact Management System** to manage contact information, featuring:
- CRUD operations for managing contacts
- Data storage using arrays/lists
- A console-based interface for interaction

### Java Chatting Application
I built a **Java Chatting Application** using socket programming, which includes:
- **One-on-One Chatting:** Real-time messaging between two users
- **Group Chatting:** Allowing up to three users to join the same chat room and communicate simultaneously
- Implementation of Java socket programming for networking
- A simple GUI for chat interaction

### Inventory Management System
I developed an **Inventory Management System** with a graphical user interface using Java Swing, which includes:
- **Item Management:** Add, update, delete, and search inventory items.
- **Data Sorting:** Sort items by name, quantity, or price.
- **Export Functionality:** Export inventory data to a CSV file.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** An intuitive GUI for managing inventory items.

### Bank Account Management System with Unit Testing
I implemented a **Bank Account Management System** featuring:
- **Account Management:** Create, view, update, and delete bank accounts.
- **Transaction Handling:** Process deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks.
- **Unit Testing:** Developed comprehensive unit tests using JUnit to ensure the reliability of the system.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages:** Java
- **Networking:** Java Sockets
- **Tools:** Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
- **Data Management:** Arrays, Lists
- **GUI:** Java Swing
- **Testing:** JUnit

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SamK1828/Shadow_Fox_Tasks.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Shadow_Fox_Tasks
    ```

## Usage

- To run the Calculator, navigate to the calculator directory and compile the Java files:
    ```bash
    javac ConsoleBasedCalculator.java
    ```
  Run the calculator:
    ```bash
    java ConsoleBasedCalculator
    ```

- To run the Contact Management System, navigate to the contact management directory and compile the Java files:
    ```bash
    javac ContactManagementSystem.java
    ```
  Run the system:
    ```bash
    java ContactManagementSystem
    ```

- To run the Chatting Application (one-on-one or group chat), navigate to the chatting application directory and compile the Java files:
    ```bash
    javac Task_Level_Advanced\RealTimeChatApplicationWithJavaSocketProgramming\Chatting Application\src\chatting\application\Client.java
    ```

    ```bash
    javac Task_Level_Advanced\RealTimeChatApplicationWithJavaSocketProgramming\Chatting Application\src\chatting\application\Server.java
    ``` 
  Run the server:
    ```bash
    java Task_Level_Advanced\RealTimeChatApplicationWithJavaSocketProgramming\Chatting Application\src\chatting\application\Server
    ```
  Run the client (repeat this step for each user):
    ```bash
    java Task_Level_Advanced\RealTimeChatApplicationWithJavaSocketProgramming\Chatting Application\src\chatting\application\Client
    ```

- To run the Inventory Management System, navigate to the inventory management directory and compile the Java files:
    ```bash
    javac InventoryManagementSystem.java
    ```
  Run the application:
    ```bash
    java InventoryManagementSystem
    ```
```bash
riya
```
