-Project 1: Enhanced Console-based Calculator
Features
Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Scientific Calculations:
Square root
Exponentiation (e.g., x^y)
Unit Conversions:
Temperature Conversion: Convert between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
Currency Conversion: (Extendable to different currencies; currently set with sample exchange rates).
-How to Use
Run the calculator by executing the Calculator.java file.
A menu will appear asking you to select an operation: basic arithmetic, scientific calculations, or unit conversions.
Enter your choice, followed by the required values. The result will be displayed after the calculation.
The calculator will loop, allowing for multiple operations until the user chooses to exit.
-Project 2: Simple Contact Management System
Features
Add Contact: Add a new contact with name, phone number, and email address.
View Contacts: Display all saved contacts.
Update Contact: Modify an existing contact's information.
Delete Contact: Remove a contact from the list.

-How to Use
Run the contact management system by executing the ContactManager.java file.
A menu will appear with options to add, view, update, delete, or search contacts.
Select the desired action and follow the prompts to enter or modify contact information.
All contacts are stored in memory for the current session (no persistent storage used).
The system will continue running until the user chooses to exit.

-Key Learning
These projects introduce essential programming concepts and patterns that are foundational to Java development:

Basic Java Syntax: Understanding data types, control structures (if-else, loops), and exception handling.
Methods: Writing and using methods to modularize code.
User Input/Output: Reading from the console and outputting information.
Error Handling: Managing exceptions, such as dividing by zero.
CRUD Operations: Managing data with Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.
Array and ArrayList: Storing and managing data using in-memory data structures.
Mathematical Functions: Leveraging Java's Math library for scientific calculations.
Technologies Used
Java: The primary programming language used for both projects.
Java Utility Libraries: For input/output operations, data structures (ArrayList), and mathematical calculations.
